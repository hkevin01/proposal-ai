## Test Results (2025-07-21)
- All service modules (API, notification, analytics) tested
- Collaboration features tested (sharing, commenting, team management)
- GUI tests run and closed out properly
- See `logs/test_output_2025-07-21-phase16.txt` for full output

## New/Updated Tests
- Added tests for collaboration features
- Verified error handling and input validation
- Confirmed logging and documentation in all modules

## Next Steps
- Expand test coverage for GUI and API endpoints
- Add edge case and integration tests
- Monitor logs for issues and improve error reporting

## Unit Tests
- `test_analytics_service.py`: Now includes tests for import features and environment validation.
- `test_interactive_dashboard.py`: Covers interactive chart rendering (smoke tests).

## Manual Tests
- Verify GUI filtering and drill-down analytics work as expected.
- Confirm API endpoint `/analytics/custom` returns correct filtered results.
- Check chart export options (PNG, PDF) in GUI.

## Edge Cases
- No proposals in analytics data
- Invalid report parameters
- All proposal counts zero

## Results
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Manual tests verified

## CI/CD
