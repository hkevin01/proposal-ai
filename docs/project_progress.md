## Technical Implementation Highlights
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema for organizations, events, proposals
- **GUI**: Modern PyQt5 with tabbed interface, threading, and professional styling
- **Scraping**: Scrapy framework with intelligent opportunity detection
- **Architecture**: Modular design with separate concerns (database, GUI, scraping)
- **Sample Data**: NASA, ESA, IAC opportunities for testing

## Next Steps
1. Test the complete application with `./run.sh`
2. Refine web scraping for real websites
3. Implement AI-powered opportunity classification
4. Begin proposal preparation features
- [x] Basic GUI framework creation

## Current Phase: Phase 2 - Opportunity Discovery Engine 🔄
**Status**: Foundation work in progress

### Completed in Phase 2:
- [x] Basic Scrapy spider structure created
- [x] PyQt GUI framework established
- [x] Initial project structure for discovery engine

### In Progress:
- [ ] Web scraping implementation for IAC website
- [ ] Database integration setup
- [ ] Opportunity search functionality

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. **Complete IAC website scraper** - Implement full scraping logic for IAC opportunities
2. **Set up database** - Create SQLite database with proper schema
3. **Implement search interface** - Connect GUI to discovery engine
4. **Add data validation** - Ensure scraped data quality
