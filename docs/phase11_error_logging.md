# Phase 11: Centralized Error Handling & Logging

## Goals
- Implement standardized error handling across all modules
- Add centralized logging configuration for file and console output

## Error Handling
- Custom exceptions in `src/utils/error_handling.py`
- Service modules refactored to use custom exceptions

## Logging
- Centralized config in `src/utils/logging_config.py`
- Logs written to both console and `logs/proposal_ai.log`

## Next Steps
- Expand error handling to GUI and API modules
- Monitor logs for issues and improve error reporting
